1. ```git checkout <commit-id>``` <br />
    - Status of the project at that commit-id along with the commit message is seen
    - The remaining project status is not modified but we have just moved back in time 
    - HEAD is in the detatched state i.e. HEAD refers to the commit-id and the not to the master branch HEAD
    - Any modifications made during the detatched HEAD does not get saved
    - The change no longer exists since ```git checkout``` is only a read-only command
    - It is a safe command and if we want to do changes in different part of the code, we do so by using branches
    - To save the modifications made during the detatched HEAD state, create a new branch and the changes will get automatically saved

*_Commands for Undoing Changes:_*

1. ```git revert <commit-id>``` <br />
    - Undo the specific commit only and not the other commit
    - Opens the code editor for writing the commit message

1. ```git reset``` <br />
    - Undo the changes and commmits but it can be dangerous as it can delete the file permanently
    - Has three flags:
        - ```git reset --soft <commit-id>```
            - Files remains in the staging area even after the commits are removed from the commit history
            - For unstaging the files use - ```git reset .```
        - ```git reset --mixed <commit-id>``` <br />
            ```git reset <commit-id>```
            - It is the default reset command
            - Files are unstaged and the commits are removed from the commit history
        - ```git reset --hard <commit-id>```
            - Commits are messages are discarded simultaneously
            - No files are in the staging or unstaging area

    > The commit-id upto which we need to revert the changes are listed in the command

*_Remote Commands:_*

1. ```git remote add origin <https-link-of-the-remote-repo>``` <br />
    Connects local repo to the remote repo

1. ```git remote remove origin``` <br />
    Removes local repo and remote repo connection

1. ```git push origin main``` <br />
    Saves the modifications from local repo to remote repo

1. ```git push -u origin main``` <br />
    Sets the tracking branch and also saves the modifications from local repo to remote repo simulataneously

1. ```git pull origin main``` <br />
    Saves the modifications from remote repo to local repo
    > git pull = git fetch + git merge

1. ```git branch --set-upstream-to=origin/<branch>main```
    - Make the local branch main to track the remote branch from the origin
    - Git will push to and pull from the set branch

*_Branching & Merging Commands:_*

1. ```git branch <branch-name>``` <br />
    Creates the new branch

1. ```git branch``` <br />
    ```git branch --list``` <br />
    Lists the branches created in the repo with the current branch appearing with a '*' mark

1. ```git branch -D <branch-name>``` <br />
    Deletes the branch
    > The branch in which we are currently present doesn't gets deleted

1. ```git checkout <branch-name>``` <br />
    Used for switching between branches

1. ```git checkout -b <branch-name>``` <br />
    Creates and switches the branches at the same time

1. ```git push origin <branch-name>``` <br />
    - Pushes new branch from local repo to the remote repo
    - On GitHub, by compare and pull request the changes can be committed

1. ```git pull origin <branch-name>``` <br />
    - Pulls new branch from remote repo to the local repo
    - The branch will be pulled in the local repo but not shown. To see the branch, we need to track that branch using ```git checkout --track origin/<branch-name>```, which will list all the branches in the repo

1. ```git merge <branch-name>``` <br />
    Merges or joins the branch

1. ```git merge --abort``` <br />
    The merge conflicts are aborted but the changes remain as it is

*Advanced Commands:_*

1. ```git diff``` <br />
    Provides difference between the current working directory and the staging area

1. ```git diff --staged``` <br />
    ```git diff --cached``` <br />
    Provides difference between the staging area and the last committed version

1. ```git diff <commit-id1> <commit-id2>``` <br />
    Provides the difference between commits

1. ```git diff HEAD~1``` <br />
    Provides the difference between current commit and previous commit

1. ```git diff <branch1> <branch2>``` <br />
    Provides the difference between tips of the two branches

1. ```git diff <commit-id>``` <br />
    Provides difference between the current working directory and the commit-id

1. ```git diff <branch>``` <br />
    Provides difference between current working directory and the branch

1. ```git config --global color.diff.old yellow``` <br />
    ```git config --global color.diff new blue``` <br />
    Use to change the default color in differences. Default colors are green (addition) and red (deletion)

1. ```git stash``` <br />
    Sometimes we need to quickly switch tasks or fix a bug, but we're not ready for committing the work, so the command lets us save the uncommitted changes and returns us to a clean working directory
